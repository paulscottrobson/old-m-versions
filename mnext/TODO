TODO List
---------
- optimise CompileWord to not page twice
- strings  (then can remove all the comments on the print)
- error is ASCIIZ string not number prefixed, so change the con.print.string there.
- fix up status (probably need far read and far write)
- some sort of multiple mark/restore
- dictionary not changed 
- far memory read and write.
